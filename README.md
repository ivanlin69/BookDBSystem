# Book Database System

## Description
This is a `C`-based program that functions as a database system to manage book information. The system allows users to view, add, remove, update, and list books. It is implemented as a Unix command line utility using getopt for command-line argument parsing.


## Features
**Unix Command Line Utility with Getopt**
- The program utilizes the getopt library to parse command-line arguments.
- Users can specify various options to perform operations on the database.

**Database Header Management**
- The program creates and validates a header for the database file.
- The header contains metadata such as magic number, version, book count, and file size.

**Book Operations**
- Add Book: Add a new book to the database.
- Remove Book: Remove an existing book from the database.
- Update Book: Update the publication year of a book.
- List Books: List all books in the database.


## Usage

**Create a New Database File**
```bash
./BookDBController -n -f <database file>
```
- -n: Create a new database file.
- -f <database file>: Path to the database file.

**Add a New Book**
  ```bash
   ./BookDBController -f <database file> -a <new book info>
   ```
- -a <new book info>: Information of the new book (title, author, genre, ISBN, year).

**List All Books**
  ```bash
   ./BookDBController -f <database file> -l
   ```
- -l: List all books in the database.

**Remove a Book:**
  ```bash
   ./BookDBController -f <database file> -r <book title>
   ```
- -r <book title>: Title of the book to be removed.

**Update Bookâ€™s Published Year**:
  ```bash
   ./BookDBController -f <database file> -u <book title, year>
   ```
- -u <book title, year>: Title of the book and the new publication year.
